Conform to the standardized practice for C# code development: 

0. MOST IMPORTANT. Comment with Intellisense docs on everything. This entails:
  - Triple "///" slash denotations on Classes, Member variables, Member functions, Constructors, Enumerations.
  - Anything that can have triple slashes very well SHOULD. Anyone who didn't develop the program should be able to 
  follow the thought process of how anything internal to the functionality of the program was designed and understand
  the inner workings.

1. Follow inline access modifier consistancy. This entails:
  - A class begins with private member fields.
  - Second in order are Public Properties, Public member methods, and public Constructors.
  - Third in order are Private member functions, or anything else that should be protected or private in access.

2. If a unit test can be developed for any of the inner workings of a class, they SHOULD be in the Unit test Project solution.

3. If a simple for loop, or logical if statement can be done in one liner style, use Curly Braces ANYWAY. Stay Consistent.

4. Use consistent spacing format. (if you sometimes declare a for loop as: for ( .. ), don't switch it up with for(..). )

5. Space reserved for future rule practice.
